# **MS&E 318: Constrained and Safe AI**

How can we design AI systems that are not only powerful but also provably safe and trustworthy? This advanced PhD seminar surveys algorithmic methods to enforce hard constraints in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and generative AI. 
Topics include classical constrained optimization (Lagrangian methods, robust and stochastic programming), 
safe reinforcement learning (trust regions, Lyapunov functions, reachability), 
hybrid ML-optimization methods (projection networks, solver-in-the-loop architectures), 
and alignment strategies for large language models (fine-tuning, model editing, tool use, and interactive alignment). 
We will consider applications to robotics, finance, healthcare, energy, and personal AI assistants. 
Topics may change according to student interest.
Prerequisites: optimization at the level of CME 307 or EE 364a.

For each topic, we will begin with a foundational mini-lecture,
followed by student-led discussion on modern research papers.
The course will culminate in a final research project
which will constitute a majority of the grade.

# Logistics

* **When:** 1:30-4:20pm Tuesdays Jan 9-March 10
* **Where:** [McCullough 122](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?srch=McCullough+122) or on [Zoom](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/6394072382?pwd=bndKcXBpRFdOb2x5VFhuT0kzN1QvQT09) by prior arrangement with the instructor
* You can schedule [Office hours](https://calendar.app.google/sCu1wpZXkUdAXdA59) on this calendar or chat with Prof. Udell after class.

# Course format and requirements

Students are required to attend class, with at most one absence.
(Any student may also attend up to one class remotely via [Zoom](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/6394072382?pwd=bndKcXBpRFdOb2x5VFhuT0kzN1QvQT09),
or more by prior arrangement with the instructor.)

Course grades have three components:

* **Quiz** (.1): Most classes will begin with a short quiz.
The questions will be easy to answer if you read the paper.
* **Present a paper** (.3): Students will each lead a discussion on a paper twice (or so), likely in teams
depending on course enrollment.
The student leading the discussion will prepare a 30 minute presentation using slides,
two quiz questions on the paper,
and a class activity or questions for discussion.
* **Research project** (.6):
The final research project should explore a new idea for safe and constrained AI.
Projects can be in teams of up to three students except by
special advance permission from the instructor.
Students will prepare an initial project proposal, midterm report, and final report
on the project, and may make an in-class presentation.
Research projects can (and should!) advance your PhD research.

<!-- Students taking the class for 1 credit will be required
to write fewer reviews,
present only one paper,
and will not be required to complete the research project.
The quiz requirement will be the same. -->
